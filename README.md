# divinationtool

# Project Title
This assignment involves us creating our own version of a divination tool. My Divination tool is a method that when you push a button, it determines the risk of the day which determines how many hours you spend outside.
 ## About
This design will have a 2 buttons. 

JS: The first button will be the user input for a random return. The second button will be a "return home" button. 

HTML: I will layout a simple page where there is a button in the body or footer and then upon pressing the button, you will see a text appear either in the header or body discussing what you must do for the day. The three risk levels are Low, Medium, and High. 

Low = 12hrs max outside (Green screen)
Medium = 8hr max outside (Yellow screen)
High = 4hr max outside (Red screen)

I will also add NYC statisticis about murders, muggings, weather concerns, and various other facts about NYC risk assesments based on the severity of the random output.
