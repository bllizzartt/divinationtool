# Divinationtool
This assignment involves us creating our own version of a divination tool. My Divination tool is a method that when you push a button, it determines the risk of the day which determines how many hours you spend outside based on a color scheme of gree, yellow, red.
 ## About
This design will have a one button. 

Button: The button will be placed in the center 

HTML: I will layout a simple page where there is a button in the body or footer and then upon pressing the button, you will see a text appear either in the header or body discussing what you must do for the day. The three risk levels are Low, Medium, and High. 

Low = 12hrs max outside (Green screen)
Medium = 8hr max outside (Yellow screen)
High = 4hr max outside (Red screen)

I will also add NYC statisticis about murders, muggings, weather concerns, and various other facts about NYC risk assesments based on the severity of the random output.

 ### Process & Documentation
This project consisted of a style.css, index.html, and index.js. The style page was straight forward and took care of the basic layout and text.
The HTML aspect incorporated the btn and layout for the website as ell as the basic Doctype setup.
The JS page I provided the basic btn setup as well as if else statements that included Math.random fuctions with three integers set to random. These three random results will change the color of the background.
### Challenges & Struggles
My biggest challenge was setting up the random function to establish the color changes upon clicking the button.
